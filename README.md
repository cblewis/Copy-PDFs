# Copy-PDFs
I wrote this program to look in a provided directory and all of that directory's subdirectories for .PDF files to copy 
to a destination directory. This simplifies the copying process and saves the user from manually searching 
subdirectories for other PDFs. This script can be changed to look for any file type in any directory's subdirectories.

Version 2 allows the user to specify a source directory into which a recursive function 
(that is to say, the script will looks into that directory and all of its subdirectories) will look for PDFs and 
copy them to a specified destination directory.
